Helper tools for doing TileStache [1] related things. For example:

* httpony.py : A bare-bone WSGI based tileserver. Personally I would prefer to
  use gunicorn/gunistache [2,3] but it doesn't work on my laptop due to weird
  OS X framework-related networking issues. [4]

  You use it like this:

  $> tilestache-tools/httpony.py -c /path/to/tilestache_config.json
  INFO:root:start server on localhost:8001
  localhost - - [11/Jun/2010 12:29:38] "GET /maplayer/13/2247/3246.png HTTP/1.1" 200 26234
